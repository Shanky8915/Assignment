ML Test
Objective: Build a model that predicts/classifies whether a website is a Phishing website.

Approach: From the given dataset, it is clear that that it is supervised learning task. The given data is the classification task. Therefore, the models considered for training are: Decision tree, Random forest and Support vector Machine (SVM)

Output:
Accuracy by applying Decision tree model on test data = 94.7%
Accuracy by applying Random forest model on test data = 94.1%
Accuracy by applying Support vector machine model on test data = 92.5%
The highest model accuracy comes out to be 94.7% in case of decision tree model.
